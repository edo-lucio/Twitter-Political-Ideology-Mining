## Mining Political Ideology: A Classification Approach through Moral Foundation Analysis 
GitHub repository for my Bachelor dissertation in Psychosocial Sciences of Communication. 
With this research I wanted to explore whether it was possible to predict users' ideological preferences by leveraging psychological theories such as the Moral Foundation Theory (MFT; Haidt, 2012) and Moral Foundation scoring tools (e.g. Mokhberian et al., 2020).
