## Mining Political Ideology: A Classification Approach through Moral Foundation Analysis 
GitHub repository for my [Bachelor dissertation](https://github.com/edoardo-lucini/Twitter-Mining-Political-Ideology/blob/main/thesis.pdf) in Psychosocial Sciences of Communication. 

With this research I explored the possibility of predicting users' ideological preferences by leveraging psychological theories such as the Moral Foundation Theory (MFT; Haidt, 2012) and Moral Foundation scoring tools (e.g. Mokhberian et al., 2020) by training a classification model with data stemming from Tweets.

Although there are limits, results suggest that it is possible to predict users' ideological preferences through Moral Foundations analysis of Tweets.
